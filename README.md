Hi Guys , here I have explained how can you install Git in your local system and can push your code to the github . Here I will be explaining you.


# We have some list of steps which you can follow along with me and push your repository to the Github.

Step 1 :- Go to the official site and download the git.(Now the question rise what is the Git?? I am not explaining anything here but only the practical work we together will be having. )

# Download git https://git-scm.com/downloads

Step 2 :- After downloading the Git please install it in your system or PC (Personal Computer)

Step 3 :- Go to the folder which you want to push to the Github . 

Step 4 :- Open any shell, Command Prompt , Terminal in the same directory which you want to push .

     For example :- You want to push  D:/projects/python 
     
     You want to push the python folder all the stuff. 
     
     Open the command prompt or shell in the same directory . 
     
     The path should be like  D:/projects/python 
     
    Step 5 :- Set up your own account in the Git.
          Follow these steps. 
          
          git --global config.name "Enter your name "
          
          For example
